                <h3>How is this different from past attempts?</h3>
                <p>We are adopting a collaborative approach to drive this cause. We have tagged this collaborative framework the Big Tent approach, which in other words, means the bill is owned by the ecosystem. The process of engagement involves all relevant stakeholders in the startup ecosystem including the government (both at regional and federal levels, as well as across the legislative, executive and judiciary arms of government to develop and submit the bill to be signed into law. This is an initiative together with #i4Policy, and, is being supported by the Innovation for Policy Foundation, an organization working to increase public policy co-creation that has experience in facilitating the co-design of startup policy and legislative frameworks in more than a dozen African countries. We are also identifying existing laws/regulations and harmonising them into this bill. We are also using the bill as an opportunity to update existing but outdated laws.</p>
